🛠 Technical Architecture

    Neuro Mirror is built on the Chrome Extension Manifest V3 standard, ensuring high performance, modern security, and long-term browser compatibility.

Key Features of the Manifest:

    Modular Design: Utilizes ES Modules (via web_accessible_resources) to break down complex UI logic into manageable components like widget.js, settings.js, and onboarding.js. This prevents "spaghetti code" and makes the codebase easy to maintain.

    Background Service Worker: Employs a non-persistent background script to monitor tab changes and user idle states, minimizing memory usage while providing real-time "Focus vs. Distracted" state evaluations.

    Shadow DOM Encapsulation: All UI overlays are injected via a Shadow Root. This ensures that the extension's styles never conflict with the website you are visiting and prevents the host site's CSS from "breaking" our widget.

Advanced Permissions:

    tabs: To monitor productivity across different URLs.
    storage & unlimitedStorage: To persist user goals and custom Base64-encoded avatars.
    idle: To automatically trigger "Sleepy" states when the user is away from the keyboard.
